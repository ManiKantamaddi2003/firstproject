#### Version Control Basics

This section dives into the fundamental Git commands and concepts you need to know to get started.

##### Initializing a Git repository

To start using Git, you need to initialize a repository. This sets up the necessary files and directories to track changes in your project. The command to initialize a Git repository is:

```
git init
```

##### Adding and committing changes

Git uses a staging area to selectively choose which changes should be included in the next commit. The typical workflow involves the following commands:

```
git add <file(s)>        # Add specific file(s) to the staging area
git add .               # Add all changes to the staging area
git commit -m "Message" # Commit the changes with a descriptive message
```

##### Viewing the commit history

The commit history shows the changes made to the repository over time. You can use the `git log` command to view the commit history, including commit messages, authors, timestamps, and more. Some useful options for `git log` are:

```
git log            # Display the full commit history
git log --oneline  # Display each commit on a single line
git log --graph    # Display the commit graph showing branch and merge history
```

##### Working with branches

Branching allows for parallel development and isolating changes in Git. With branches, you can work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Here are some common branch-related commands:

```
git branch             # List all branches in the repository
git branch <branch>    # Create a new branch
git checkout <branch>  # Switch to a different branch
git merge <branch>     # Merge changes from one branch into the current branch
```

Understanding how to create branches, switch between branches, and merge changes will empower you to work on multiple tasks simultaneously and collaborate effectively with other team members.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of the basic Git commands for initializing a repository, adding and committing changes, viewing the commit history, and working with branches.

Continue to the `branching-and-merging.md` file to learn more about branching and merging in Git.
